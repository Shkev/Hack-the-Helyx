# Hack The Helix Project
By  Adi, Shayan, Jolene, and Harsh

<p>
Our mission is to create an accessible, convenient network of user-provided public EV charging stations, to both help users and in turn help support this eco-friendly movement. 
<br/>
<br/>
Our product is a virtual map on our website. It contains the locations of different EV chargers owned by users of the site in addition to public charging stations that are already established. Users can then use the chargers for a given amount of time to charge their car. Our product works by searching through our user created database of chargers and displaying the ones nearest to the user’s location by zip code or city. Each user will first create an account on our website, and they will also have the option to register their home EV charger into our database. Then, users will be able to see the charger types, prices, and ratings of charging stations around them to decide when and where they want to schedule a time to use a charger; scheduling will only apply to user-provided chargers not public ones. The pricing of using a user-provided charger will then be determined by our algorithm that accounts for the time spent charging, the power output of the charger, and the additional electric bill ($/kWh) the provider has to pay. In fact, this can be a form of passive income for the provider since the price the person using a user-provided charger will pay a 20% fee, encouraging users to register their charger with us. The provider will then take 85% of the 20% fee, and our company will receive the remaining 15% of the 20% fee.

ElectriShare’s target market will be focused on Gen X and Millennials because they are the ones who are most likely to buy an electric vehicle according to TrueCar data. Research also shows that Millennials make up around 30% of the world's population and are arguably the most concerned generation when it comes to environmental sustainability and social issues. This means that they will be more compelled to buy EVs and use our website to find EV charging stations. They also have the spending power to do so with a predicted spending power of $1.4 trillion in 2020. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, to advertise our company to the public, ElectriShare will be focusing on publicizing to our target market through Instagram and Facebook. ElectriShare’s Facebook and Instagram account and ads will increase awareness for our brand while attracting new users, and it is the perfect platform to reach millennials as they make up the majority of social media and spend a lot of time on it. We will also use email marketing to communicate with our target market, mainly targeting Gen X. This generation is already constantly checking their emails for work and updates from family, so it’s natural that they would react positively to emails. 
<br />
<br />
To differentiate our company from others, ElectriShare is strongly committed to giving back to the sustainability movement. Because of this, 10% of our profits will be also donated to 350, an international movement of ordinary people working to end the age of fossil fuels and build a world of community-led renewable energy for all.
